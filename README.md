# Viterbi_Algorithm_Python

The Viterbi Algorithm file showcases a working example of how the titular algorithm works.

The algorithm is explained in great lengths here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm. Essentially the algorithm is a speech recognition tool used to pick up on vocal cues and observations and algorithmically determine the most probable message based on the said sounds.

This project was made under the environment of one of my undergraduate classes, CSE 150 Artificial Intelligence.

Due to the nature of how many observations are processed, the code runs for an extraordinarily long time anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes.

The final resultant message that is decoded is the follows: "a democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others"
